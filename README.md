# snailfill
A demonstration of the flood fill algorithm in Python using snails and yarn balls as a metaphor.

Work in progress. The snailfill.py program works but you need to install the bext module with `pip install bext`. I'm less than happy with it, and I think the next best step is to make a graphical version in JavaScript that can be run in the browser.
